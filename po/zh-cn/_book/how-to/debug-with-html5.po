"You can use `console.log` to log infomation on console, but it's hightly "
"recommended to use `nativeLog` instead, since nativeLog can run on a native "
"platform besides on a browser. The defect of `nativeLog` is that it's not "
"supported to trace it from the console to the source file which the "
"`nativeLog` is called in, therefore in this situation you'd better use "
"`console.log`, and you should make sure this code will not run on native "
"platform (otherwise a exception or a crash will be caused)."
